# LangChain for LLM Application Development - deeplearning.ai

Welcome to my **LangChain for LLM Application Development** repository! This repo contains Jupyter notebooks for reworking the course content [Deeplearning.AI](https://learn.deeplearning.ai).

The goal of this repo is to document my learning journey throughout this course.

## Course Chapters

For each chapter I have created / will create a Jupyter notebook to re-work the content:

1. **Lesson 1**: Introduction (completed)
2. **Lesson 2**: [Models, Prompts and parsers](./lessons/chapter2.ipynb) (completed)
3. **Lesson 3**: [Memory](./lessons/chapter3.ipynb) (completed)
4. **Lesson 4**: [Chains](./lessons/chapter4.ipynb) (completed)
5. **Lesson 5**: [Question and Answer]()
6. **Lesson 6**: [Evaluation]()
7. **Lesson 7**: [Agents]()
8. **Lesson 8**: [Conclusion]()
