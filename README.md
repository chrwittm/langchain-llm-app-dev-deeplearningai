# LangChain for LLM Application Development - Deeplearning.AI

Welcome to my [**LangChain for LLM Application Development**](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/langchain/)  repository! This repo contains Jupyter notebooks for reworking the course from [Deeplearning.AI](https://learn.deeplearning.ai).

The goal of this repo is to document my learning journey throughout this course.

## Course Chapters

For each chapter I have created / will create a Jupyter notebook to re-work the content:

1. **Lesson 1**: Introduction (3:05) (completed)
2. **Lesson 2**: [Models, Prompts and parsers](./lessons/chapter2.ipynb) (18:22) (completed)
3. **Lesson 3**: [Memory](./lessons/chapter3.ipynb) (17:04)  (completed)
4. **Lesson 4**: [Chains](./lessons/chapter4.ipynb) (13:07) (completed)
5. **Lesson 5**: [Question and Answer](./lessons/chapter5.ipynb) (15:06) (completed)
6. **Lesson 6**: [Evaluation](./lessons/chapter6.ipynb) (15:06) (completed)
7. **Lesson 7**: [Agents](./lessons/chapter7.ipynb) (14:35) (completed)
8. **Lesson 8**: [Conclusion](./lessons/Conclusion.md) (1:44) (completed)
