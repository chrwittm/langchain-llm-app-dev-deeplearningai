    "\n",
    "Instead of using an `f-string` for the prompt, we can use a prompt template. While the result may seem the same at first, a prompt template offers greater flexibility when scaling up a project. The key advantages of using prompt templates are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reusability and Modularity**: With the `f-string` approach, variables are directly linked to the runtime code. In contrast, prompt templates allow variables to be inserted dynamically, making them reusable across different parts of the application or runtime environments.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Separation of Logic and Content**: In the current example notebook, prompts are embedded directly within the code. However, in larger projects, prompts are often stored separately from the logic, such as in a configuration file or a database. This clear separation between logic and content simplifies the management of both, making the code more maintainable and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error Handling and Validation**: Prompt templates provide better error handling by ensuring that all required variables are supplied before formatting the template. This helps catch potential issues earlier and makes the code more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining the prompt template, notice that the text is the same as above, but it is not written as f-string. Instead, it is a \"regular\" string. The variables are still included in curly braces. To fill in the variables, we use the `format` method."
